This dissertation examines the effects of concurrent cognitive and physical effort on task performance and physiological arousal across multiple cognitive domains. Chapter 1 investigates how task difficulty and physical effort interact in visual working memory, auditory perception, and visual perception tasks in younger adults. Results reveal independent effects of task difficulty on behavioral performance and physical effort on pupillary arousal, with no significant interactions. These findings suggest that cognitive and physical effort may rely on distinct resource pools, at least at moderate effort levels in healthy young adults. The implications for theories of limited-capacity resources and adaptive gain are discussed.
