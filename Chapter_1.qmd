## Abstract

Cognitive and physical effort are often exerted concurrently in daily life, yet they are typically studied separately with few studies of their combined impact on performance limited to the working memory domain. This study systematically examined effects of concurrent task difficulty (Easy vs. Hard stimulus similarity) and physical effort (Low vs. High handgrip) on both behavioral performance and task-evoked pupil response in three cognitive tasks (visual working memory, auditory perception, visual perception) in healthy younger adults. Results revealed main effects of task difficulty on performance in all tasks, with participants being less accurate and slower in the Hard vs. Easy condition. There were no main effects of physical effort or interactions with task difficulty on performance. The pupil response showed only significant main effects of physical effort for all tasks, with larger pupil response during High vs. Low effort conditions. Individual-level analyses also revealed no significant correlations between behavioral and pupillary response to effort. Overall, our findings do not support the notion that task difficulty and physical effort draw on common limited-capacity resources or that they similarly impact pupillary arousal, at least for the effort levels used here in healthy young adults.

## Significance Statement

In many real-world settings, people engage in cognitively demanding tasks while simultaneously exerting physical effort—for example, pushing a shopping cart while remembering items on our grocery list and searching for them in the aisles or gripping the steering wheel of a car while navigating through busy streets and intersections to our destination. Whether concurrent task difficulty and physical effort have interactive effects on task performance has been relatively understudied, despite practical implications for safety and performance in work, transportation, and everyday activities. The current study tested for these interactive effects across three cognitive domains (visual working memory, auditory and visual perceptual discrimination) in healthy younger adults. Our results showed that harder task difficulty impaired performance (lower accuracy, slower responses), whereas higher physical effort increased the pupil response. However, there were no interactions between task difficulty and physical effort. These findings have theoretical implications for the extent to which task difficulty and physical effort draw on shared resources or induce physiological arousal and practical implications for performance effects across a variety of real-world tasks with concurrent cognitive and physical demands.

## Introduction

Cognitive effort refers to the mental exertion required to perform a task [@westbrook2015cognitive], and its effects on task performance have long been studied by manipulating task difficulty [e.g., @Kahneman1966-jf; @Beatty1982-wl]. Yet in the real world, we often perform cognitively demanding tasks while simultaneously exerting physical effort, such as pushing a shopping cart while remembering items on our grocery list and searching for them in the aisles or gripping the steering wheel of a car while navigating through busy streets and intersections to our destination. A much smaller literature has shown that concurrently manipulating task difficulty and physical effort can result in interactive effects on task performance [e.g., @Azer2023-ft; @Park2021-rs], although these investigations have been largely limited to the working memory domain [e.g., @Azer2023-ft; @voelcker2007dual]. Thus, it remains unknown whether similar interactions are seen between perceptual task difficulty and concurrent physical effort.

Increasing task difficulty imposes a cognitive cost that manifests as observable performance decrements, specifically reduced accuracy or slower reaction times [@westbrook2015cognitive]. For example, in working memory tasks, participants perform worse on conditions that involve more to-be-remembered items (hard task difficulty) relative to conditions with fewer to-be-remembered items (easy task difficulty) [@gazzaley2005top; @vangerven2004memory; @Kahneman1966-jf; @cowan2001magical; @vogel2004neural; @Cappiello2018-wv; @salthouse1991theoretical]. Similarly, for auditory [e.g., @Green1966-zu; @Naatanen1990-sz; @zekveld2018pupil] and visual [e.g., @Beatty1982-wl; @lavie1995perceptual; @carrasco2011visual] perceptual discrimination tasks, participants are less accurate when sounds or images are more similar to a target stimulus (hard task difficulty) than when they are less similar (easy task difficulty). Thus, increased task difficulty—whether through working memory load or perceptual similarity—consistently reveals performance costs across both memory and perceptual domains.

Physical effort can be measured using isometric handgrip exercises, in which participants are asked to maintain stationary grip force at a precise effort level, usually relative to their maximum voluntary contraction [MVC; @lind1967cardiovascular]. Relative to mobility-based physical effort [e.g., walking; @hausdorff2008dual; @plummer2012effects], isometric handgrip exercise captures real-world physical demands, such as carrying objects or gripping a steering wheel [@Azer2023-ft; @eksioglu2008steering]. Effects of physical effort on task performance are commonly studied asynchronously, that is, by comparing performance after versus before a period of handgrip exercise [@brown2015isometric; @washio2021acute; @saito2021effects; @yamada2021effects; @okamoto2022effects]. For example, after exerting moderate-to-high handgrip levels (30, 50, and 70% of MVC; high physical effort), participants performed worse (made more errors) on a working memory (Stroop) task relative to a control group that did not perform the handgrip manipulation (low physical effort; @brown2015isometric). However, less is known about whether performance costs for (asynchronous) physical effort extend to perceptual tasks.

Our group is among the few that have examined effects of *concurrent* task difficulty and physical effort manipulations, with both studies examining working memory performance using visual search paradigms in younger adults. In one study [@Park2021-rs], we found a reaction time cost to the presence (hard task difficulty) versus absence (easy task difficulty) of a distractor that was larger for the moderate (40% of MVC) than low (5% of MVC) handgrip condition. However, in another study [@Azer2023-ft], younger adults showed performance costs (slower, less accurate) to harder task difficulty (distractor present vs absent), but no significant effect of physical effort (30% vs 5% of MVC) or interaction between task difficulty and physical effort. This may suggest that 40% MVC is a more appropriate moderate level for taxing physical effort in younger adults relative to the low effort 5% MVC baseline; although this claim would be strengthened by replicating the main effects and interaction in a new sample and by testing whether the interactive effects of task difficulty and physical effort are present for other cognitive domains beyond visual working memory, such as visual and auditory perception.

One might expect that the previously observed interaction between task difficulty and physical effort would be observed across multiple cognitive domains if they place demands on common underlying systems. This interpretation is consistent with a limited-capacity framework [@kahneman1973attention; @wickens2008multiple], where simultaneous demands from hard task difficulty and high physical effort manipulations overwhelm a finite shared resource pool. However, an alternative explanation rooted in Adaptive Gain Theory [@astonjones2005adaptive; @eldar2013effects; @Sara2012-bg] is that simultaneously high task difficulty and high physical effort demands lead to excessive arousal, which in turn impairs performance. Support for this alternative view would be strengthened by using measures of physiological arousal, such as task-evoked pupil responses [TEPR; @Gilzenrat2010-ye; @Joshi2020-il], and demonstrating that this marker of arousal is higher for hard versus easy task difficulty and high versus low physical effort conditions.

The present study was designed to systematically investigate the effect of concurrent task difficulty (easy vs hard discrimination conditions using low vs high stimulus similarity) and physical effort (low vs high handgrip conditions using 5% vs 40% of MVC) manipulations across three distinct cognitive domains: visual working memory, auditory perception, and visual perception. Our primary aim was to replicate the consistent finding of worse performance for hard versus easy task difficulty in the concurrent task design, and conduct novel tests for both worse performance for high versus low physical effort conditions and for an interaction such that the task difficulty performance cost would be greatest for the high physical effort condition. Our secondary aim was to test whether pupil response (TEPR) showed similar effects of task difficulty, physical effort, and their interaction, as predicted by the Adaptive Gain Theory but not the limited-capacity framework. Relationships between task performance and pupil response were also examined.

## Methods

### Participants

Forty participants were recruited from fliers displayed at the University of California, Riverside and surrounding areas, social media, or word-of-mouth. To be eligible for this study, participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 30 years old, able to understand English, right-handed, have normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity via contact lenses, and self-report having good overall health and cognitive ability. All participants provided informed consent and received monetary compensation for their participation. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Riverside. Two participants were excluded due to poor performance (i.e., mean accuracy on any of the three tasks that was more than three standard deviations below the group mean). This resulted in a final sample of 38 participants (M=22.9 years, SD=3.0 years, 57.8% Female).

### Experimental Design Overview

Participants completed four experimental sessions, three of which will be the focus of the current study because they involved tasks that concurrently manipulated task difficulty and physical effort in three cognitive domains (working memory, auditory discrimination, visual discrimination). Data from the fourth session using a long-term memory task is not included in the current study because task difficulty and physical effort were not manipulated concurrently. Session 1 began with informed consent followed by instructional videos detailing the isometric handgrip procedure and an overview of each cognitive task. Participants then completed the initial Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) measurement followed by the first of the four cognitive tasks. Sessions 2-4 included MVC measurement followed by one of the three remaining tasks. The order of the tasks was counterbalanced across participants using a modified Williams design [@Williams1949-mw]. Sessions were separated by at least 24 hours with all sessions typically completed within 9 to 15 days.

### Maximum Voluntary Contraction

A Vernier hand dynamometer (Vernier Software & Technology, Beaverton, OR) was used to measure Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) at the start of each testing session and to record hand grip for the physical effort manipulation in each cognitive task. In each testing session, average MVC was assessed by asking participants to squeeze the dynamometer as hard as possible for 5 seconds, repeating this process three times, and then averaging the three maximal contractions.

### Cognitive Tasks

All cognitive tasks were controlled by a Dell Alienware laptop running MATLAB R2021b with the Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3.0.18 [@Brainard1997-fk; @Kleiner2007-fu; @Pelli1997-sy]. Stimuli were presented on a 19-inch ViewSonic PF817 CRT monitor (1280x960 resolution, 85 Hz refresh rate) viewed from a distance of 50 cm in a quiet, dimly lit room and screens were isoluminant across fixation periods. Responses were collected using designated keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard.

For each task, physical effort was manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis by cueing participants to exert Low (5% of their Session 1 MVC) or High (40% of their Session 1 MVC) force on the dynamometer and maintain that grip force until the response screen (~5.25s). Task difficulty was also manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis by systematically varying probe/target stimulus similarity relative to the studied/standard stimulus, with four levels of similarity that were averaged into Easy and Hard task difficulty conditions, as detailed next. Additional task details are described next and trial schematics are provided in @fig-task-schematics.

Accuracy and reaction time were recorded on each trial. Reaction time was measured from the onset of the response window for all tasks. For Change Detection Task (CDT), the arrow appeared at response window onset, whereas for Auditory Discrimination Task (ADT) and Visual Discrimination Task (VDT), the target stimulus was presented prior to the response window onset. Confidence ratings were also collected, but were not analyzed for the current study.

![Overall schematics are provided for the Change Detection Task (CDT), Auditory Discrimination Task (ADT), and Visual Discrimination Task (VDT). Pink boxes show the duration that hand grip was maintained at either 5% or 40% of their MVC.](figures/chapter1/figure1_task_schematics.png){#fig-task-schematics}

A **Change Detection Task (CDT)** [@Cappiello2018-wv] was used to assess visual working memory. On each of 180 trials, participants studied an array of three arrows surrounding a fixation. After a brief delay, a single probe arrow appeared in one of the three locations in the same orientation as the studied arrow (20% of trial) or in one of four different orientations (20% of trials for each orientation). Participants indicated whether the probe arrow orientation was the same or different to the studied arrow in the same location. Task difficulty was manipulated by varying the magnitude of the orientation difference between the studied and probe arrows on "different" trials, binarized into Easy (large 45° or 90° rotations) and Hard (small 5° or 20° rotations) conditions.

An **Auditory Discrimination Task (ADT)** [@Murphy2011-nr; @Naatanen1990-sz] was used to assess auditory frequency discrimination. On each of 250 trials, participants heard a standard tone (1000 Hz) followed by either the same standard tone (20% of trial) or one of four different tones (20% of trials for each frequency offset). Participants indicated if the two tones were the same or different. Task difficulty was manipulated by varying the frequency difference between the standard tone and the target tone on "different" trials, binarized into Easy (large frequency offsets of +32 or +128 Hz) and Hard (small frequency offsets of +4 or +8 Hz) conditions.

A **Visual Discrimination Task (VDT)** [@Polat1994-nv] was used to assess visual contrast discrimination. On each of 250 trials, participants viewed a standard Gabor patch (6 cycles/degree, 4° diameter, 100ms duration) followed by either the same standard Gabor patch (20% of trial) or one of four different Gabor patches (20% of trials for each contrast offset). Participants indicated if the two Gabor patches were the same or different. Task difficulty was manipulated by varying the contrast difference between the standard and the target Gabor patches on "different" trials, binarized into Easy (large contrast offsets of +0.16 or +0.32) and Hard (small contrast offsets of +0.04 or +0.08) conditions.

### Pupillometry

A tower-mounted EyeLink 1000 (SR Research) recorded left-eye pupil diameter at 1000 Hz (spatial resolution <0.01° RMS; pupil resolution 0.2%) while performing the task. Preprocessing followed current recommendations [cf. @mathot2018pupillometry; @mathot2023best; @laeng2024pupillometry]: blinks were detected and padded, samples within masks were interpolated (short-gap PCHIP/linear), a light low-pass smoothing was applied (e.g., Savitzky–Golay), and data were then down-sampled to 100 Hz.

To quantify the task-evoked pupil response (TEPR) given the concurrent physical and cognitive demands of the tasks, we first generated full-trial pupil waveforms, adapted from @Zenon2014-ze, for all experimental conditions relative to a pre-trial baseline (B₀; 500 ms window). Total area under the curve (Total AUC) was measured from trial onset until the start of the response window. Next, to isolate the TEPR to cognitive demands of the tasks, we generated partial-trial pupil waveforms for all experimental conditions relative to onset of a pre-probe/target stimulus baseline (500 ms window). Cognitive AUC was measured from 300 ms after the probe/target stimulus onset (to account for physiological latency) until the start of the response window. Prior to AUC calculation, trials were excluded if either baseline window contained insufficient valid data (≥10 samples required for baseline calculation; as in prior work @mathot2018pupillometry).

### Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were conducted in R (Version 4.5.1). First, to assess the direct effects of Task Difficulty and Physical Effort on task performance, we fit generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for accuracy and linear mixed models (LMMs) for reaction time data from each task. Second, to assess the effects of Task Difficulty and Physical Effort on the pupillary response, we fit separate LMMs for each AUC measure (Total, Cognitive) from each task. Note that Cognitive AUC was not calculated for CDT because the probe stimulus that indicated the task difficulty condition was presented after the AUC measurement window (i.e., during the response window).

All models were conducted separately for each task using the lme4 package in R [@bates2015fitting]. They included Task Difficulty (Easy, Hard), Physical Effort (Low, High), and their interaction as fixed effects, with a random intercept for each participant. The significance of fixed effects was determined using Wald tests from the model summaries.

To examine whether individual differences in Task Difficulty- and Physical Effort-related task performance were associated with physiological arousal (i.e., pupil response), we computed within-subject difference scores for each task condition (Hard minus Easy Task Difficulty, High minus Low Physical Effort) and then averaged these contrasts to obtain one value per participant for each effect. Behavioral measures included accuracy and mean correct reaction time; physiological measures included Total AUC and Cognitive AUC. Pearson correlations were conducted between the participant-level behavioral and AUC difference scores for each task, with 95% confidence intervals and two-tailed p-values reported.

**LLM/AI tool use**: Cursor was used to assist with code troubleshooting; all analyses and results were verified by the authors.

## Results

### Effects of Task Difficulty and Physical Effort on Task Performance

Separate GLMMs on accuracy (see @fig-performance, top row) revealed significant main effects of Task Difficulty for all tasks, with lower accuracy on the Hard relative to Easy condition for CDT (*b* = -2.32, SE = 0.09, *z* = -24.71), ADT (*b* = -5.28, SE = 0.13, *z* = -39.52), and VDT (*b* = -3.15, SE = 0.10, *z* = -31.76; all *p*s < .001). There were no significant main effects of Physical Effort (all *p*s > .152) and no interactions between Task Difficulty and Physical Effort (all *p*s > .159) for any task.

Separate LMMs on reaction time for each task (see @fig-performance, bottom row) revealed significant main effects of Task Difficulty for all tasks, with slower responses on the Hard relative to Easy condition for CDT (*b* = 0.21, SE = 0.04, *t* = 5.89; mean reaction time difference = 171 ms), ADT (*b* = 0.62, SE = 0.05, *t* = 13.27; mean reaction time difference = 326 ms), and VDT (*b* = 0.25, SE = 0.03, *t* = 9.28; mean reaction time difference = 102 ms; all *p*s < .001). There were no significant main effects of Physical Effort (all *p*s > .157) and no interactions between Task Difficulty and Physical Effort (all *p*s > .147) for any task. Note that reaction time was log-transformed for analysis to meet model assumptions, but mean values and differences are reported in milliseconds for interpretability.

### Effects of Task Difficulty and Physical Effort on the Pupillary Response

Pupil waveforms across the whole trial relative to the same pre-trial baseline are provided for all experimental conditions in @fig-pupil-waveforms. Note that the waveform returned to baseline at ~8 seconds after the trial-onset. Separate LMMs for Total AUC (see @fig-auc-plots, top row) revealed significant main effects of Physical Effort for all tasks, with larger AUCs for the High relative to Low condition for CDT (*b* = -257.03, SE = 28.45, *t* = -9.03), ADT (*b* = -263.32, SE = 30.13, *t* = -8.74), and VDT (*b* = -175.89, SE = 31.95, *t* = -5.51; all *p*s < .001). There were no significant main effects of Task Difficulty (all *p*s > .37) and no interactions between Task Difficulty and Physical Effort for ADT or VDT (all *p*s > .38; CDT was not considered due to its AUC measurement window not including the probe stimulus). Separate LMMs for Cognitive AUC relative to the same pre-probe/target stimulus baseline (see @fig-auc-plots, bottom row) revealed no significant main effects of Task Difficulty (all ps > .18) or Physical Effort (all *p*s > .38) nor their interaction (all *p*s > .21) for both ADT and VDT.

### Individual Differences

Pearson correlations revealed no significant associations between difference scores and pupillary AUC metrics. Total AUC did not significantly relate accuracy to Physical Effort difference scores (all *p*s > .34), Task Difficulty difference score (all *p*s > .24) for any task. Similarly, Total AUC did not significantly relate correct reaction time to Physical Effort difference scores (all *p*s > .65), Task Difficulty difference score (all *p*s > .14) for any task. Cognitive AUC did not significantly relate accuracy to Physical Effort difference scores (all *p*s > .63), Task Difficulty difference score (all *p*s > .43) for any task. Similarly, Cognitive AUC did not significantly relate correct reaction time to Physical Effort difference scores (all *p*s > .46), Task Difficulty difference score (all *p*s > .10) for any task.

## Discussion

The present study extended prior research by systematically examining the effect of concurrent task difficulty (less similar/Easy vs. more similar/Hard) and physical effort (5% MVC/Low vs. 40% MVC/High) on behavioral performance and pupil responses across three cognitive domains: visual working memory, auditory perception, and visual perception. Our results replicated main effects of task difficulty, but not physical effort, on performance across all three tasks, with less accurate and slower responses when discriminating between more similar stimuli. We also replicated main effects of physical effort, but not task difficulty, on the pupillary response across all tasks, with larger Total AUC during High compared to Low physical effort conditions. However, we observed no significant interactions between task difficulty and physical effort for performance on any task. This finding contradicted predictions of both limited-capacity resource and Adaptive Gain theories, which propose that worse performance during high concurrent demands is due to an overwhelmed shared resource pool or excessive arousal, respectively. The lack of significant interactions for pupillary responses or relationships to task performance further did not support an Adaptive Gain Theory interpretation. Together, these findings in a healthy younger adult sample suggest that task difficulty and physical effort independently influence performance and pupillary responses across working memory and perceptual domains.

As predicted, we observed robust main effects of task difficulty on behavioral performance across all three cognitive tasks, with less accurate and slower responses during Hard trials compared to Easy trials. This pattern of results replicated a large and foundational body of literature demonstrating the classic effects that working memory performance is worse when memory load is higher [e.g., @gazzaley2005top; @Kahneman1966-jf] and that perceptual discrimination for both auditory [e.g., @Green1966-zu; @Naatanen1990-sz] and visual [e.g., @Beatty1982-wl] stimuli is worse when similarity between targets and non-targets is higher. Beyond simple replication, a key strength of the current study is that we demonstrated these task difficulty effects across three distinct cognitive domains—visual memory, auditory perception, and visual perception—within the same sample of participants.

We did not observe significant main effects of physical effort on behavioral performance for any cognitive tasks. This is consistent with one study from our group that used slightly lower physical effort levels and examined working memory performance using visual search paradigms in younger adults (30% vs. 5% of MVC; @Azer2023-ft), but not with our other study that used the same physical effort levels as those used here (40% vs. 5% of MVC; @Park2021-rs). We speculate that the low-to-moderate levels of physical effort used by our group may not be sufficiently demanding to consistently produce behavioral costs in younger adults, even though the High physical effort condition did elicit a larger pupil response compared to the Low physical effort condition. Consistent with this interpretation, the asynchronous physical effort literature that has shown impaired task performance following handgrip exercise used moderate-to-high levels of physical effort [e.g., 30-70% MVC in @brown2015isometric]. An alternative possibility is that physical effort effects are small, if present at all, when there are concurrent task demands. For example, a fatiguing concurrent handgrip protocol was found to have no effect on an inhibitory control task [Eriksen Flanker; @thibault2019concurrent] and concurrent cycling (even at hard intensity) had no effect on a related task [Go/No-Go; @blakely2023perceptions]. Additional research is needed to understand whether, and under what conditions, physical effort influences cognitive performance in younger adults.

Of particular interest in the current study was whether there was an interaction between task difficulty and physical effort on task performance, which we did not observe for any task. Our group previously reported larger effects of task difficulty (distractor present vs. absent) for moderate compared to low physical effort conditions in one study that also observed significant effects of task difficulty and physical effort [@Park2021-rs], but not in our other study that similarly did not observe a physical effort effect on working memory performance [@Azer2023-ft]. Thus, the current null interactions may simply be due to the absence of a strong enough physical effort effect on performance. Of note, the lack of both a main effect of physical effort and an interaction between task difficulty and physical effort is not consistent with either a limited-capacity framework in which simultaneous demands from hard task difficulty and high physical effort conditions would overwhelm a finite shared resource pool [@kahneman1973attention; @wickens2008multiple] or with Adaptive Gain Theory in which these combined conditions would lead to excessive arousal that would in turn impair performance [@astonjones2005adaptive; @eldar2013effects; @Sara2012-bg].

To further test the Adaptive Gain Theory interpretation, we examined effects of task difficulty, physical effort, and their interaction on the pupil response. We observed significant effects of physical effort on all three tasks, with larger Total AUCs during High (40% MVC) compared to Low (5% MVC) physical effort conditions. This demonstrates that our physical effort manipulation successfully increased physiological arousal during each task. Yet, as noted above, this physiological effect was not accompanied by corresponding differences in behavioral performance. In contrast, there were no significant effects of task difficulty on the pupil response, yet there were significant task difficulty-related differences in behavioral performance. Moreover, our individual differences analyses failed to reveal any significant associations between the effects of effort on the pupil response and task performance. Together, these findings suggest that distinct mechanisms are driving the pupil response (e.g., general arousal, mental effort) and behavioral performance (e.g., task-dependent difficulty, task engagement), consistent with prior work showing that the pupil may not respond to effort in the same way as behavior [e.g., @vanderwel2018pupil], calling into question whether the pupil response is an appropriate marker of task-related arousal or effort. Perhaps related to this, our findings for the pupil response do not support an Adaptive Gain interpretation.

A key strength of the current study is that it is the first to examine concurrent effects of task difficulty and physical effort across multiple cognitive domains. Yet it is not without limitations. For example, one methodological issue was that we could not examine effects of task difficulty on the pupil response in the CDT given that the difficulty of a given trial was revealed during the response period, which was after the measurement window of the pupil response. We also elected to use two levels of physical effort based on our prior work, but those low-to-moderate levels may not have been high enough to influence behavioral performance in the healthy younger adult population examined here. Additional research using higher (or a larger range of) physical effort levels, other methods for modelling performance (e.g., psychometric curves), or examining populations with well-documented dual-task challenges (such as older adults; @lindenberger2000balance; @woollacott2002attention) is needed to further test for the performance costs and interactions of interest, but not observed, here. Future research may also benefit from exploring other measures of physiological arousal (e.g., Galvanic skin response).

## Conclusions

In summary, the current study sought to examine the concurrent effects of task difficulty and physical effort on visual working memory, auditory perception, and visual perception performance. For all cognitive tasks, performance was worse for the Hard versus Easy task difficulty condition, whereas the pupil response was higher for the High versus Low physical effort conditions. However, there were no significant interactions between task difficulty and physical effort for performance or pupil response outcomes and no relationships between the effort effects on performance and pupil responses. Thus, our findings do not support a limited-capacity resource or an excessive arousal interpretation. Instead, our findings suggest that task difficulty and physical effort rely on distinct cognitive resources, at least for the low-to-moderate physical effort levels studied here in a healthy young adult population.
