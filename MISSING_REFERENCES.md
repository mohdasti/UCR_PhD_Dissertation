## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Export from Your Reference Manager
If you use Zotero, Mendeley, or Paperpile, export these specific references as BibTeX and append to `references.bib`.

### Option 2: Use Google Scholar
1. Search for the paper
2. Click "Cite" → "BibTeX"
3. Copy and paste into `references.bib`
4. Note the citation key (e.g., `westbrook2015cognitive`)
5. Update in `Chapter_1.qmd` if needed

### Option 3: Check Other Bib Files
You have other bib files that might contain some of these:
- `/Users/mohdasti/Downloads/references_May31.bib`
